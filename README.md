1. Project Title:
   Customer Acquisition & Sales Performance Analysis: Python & Plotly
   An analytical project that evaluates customer acquisition costs, revenue generation, and ROI across marketing channels — using Python and interactive visualizations to guide strategic business decisions.
       
2. Purpose of the project:
   The project aims to assess sales performance and customer acquisition efficiency over a given time period. By uncovering key trends in acquisition costs, revenue, and ROI, the analysis provides insights that can optimize     future sales strategies and improve channel effectiveness.
   
3. Tech Stack:
   The project was built using the following tools and technologies:
   ✔ Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data cleaning, transformation, and structuring.
   ✔ Plotly – Interactive data visualization (bar charts, pie charts).
   ✔ CSV Dataset – Customer acquisition and revenue records.
   
4. Data Source: Dataset includes customer acquisition cost, revenue generated, and acquisition channels such as paid advertising, email marketing, referrals, and social media. Preprocessing was performed using Pandas to         handle structure and ensure readiness for visualization.
  
5. Features / Highlights:
   ✔ Business Problem: High marketing costs and uncertain returns make it difficult for businesses to evaluate which acquisition channels drive profitability. Without structured analysis, resources may be misallocated.
   ✔ Goal of the Dashboard:
        ➡ To measure the effectiveness of acquisition channels.
        ➡ Identify profitable strategies.
        ➡ Optimize sales performance using data-driven insights.
   
   ✔ Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
      ➡ Customer Acquisition Cost (Distribution): Most acquisitions occur at a cost of 10, indicating efficiency, while spikes at 30 highlight inefficiencies.
      ➡ Revenue Distribution (Bar Chart): Revenue peaks at 1000, 3000, and 4000, showing opportunities to target high-value customer segments.
      ➡ Acquisition Cost by Channel (Pie/Bar Charts): Paid advertising is the costliest and least profitable, while email marketing emerges as the most cost-effective channel. Referrals and social media strike a balance.
      ➡ Conversion Effectiveness (Bar Chart): Social media has the highest conversion rate, followed by referrals, while paid advertising lags behind.
      ➡ ROI by Channel (Bar Chart): Email marketing leads with the highest ROI, followed by referrals and social media. Paid advertising performs poorly, suggesting optimization is needed.

   ✔ Business Impact & Insights:
      ➡ Channel Prioritization: Focus on email marketing and referrals to maximize ROI.
      ➡ Cost Optimization: Reassess paid advertising strategies to reduce high acquisition costs.
      ➡ Customer Targeting: Revenue peaks indicate the presence of high-value segments worth targeting.
      ➡ Marketing Efficiency: Balanced investments in referrals and social media deliver stable returns.
